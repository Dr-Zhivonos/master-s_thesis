# master-s_thesis

This Jupyter Notebook contains the full practical part of the master's thesis titled:
"Application of Machine Learning Methods for Evaluating and Optimizing Customer LTV in the Food Service Industry."

The notebook is organized as follows:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
    - Importing and briefly analyzing transactional data from a fast-food restaurant chain.
2. Feature Engineering
    - Generation of RFM features, time-based metrics, and additional statistical attributes relevant to customer LTV prediction.
3.1. Regression Task — LTV Monetary Value
    - Comparison of ML models using base feature set
    - Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for the top-performing models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
    - Final model selection and predictions
3.2. Classification Task — LTV Response
    - Comparison of ML models using base feature set
    - Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for the top-performing models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
    - Final model selection and predictions
4. Results and Post-Modeling Analysis
    - Visualization and interpretation of predictions
    - Customer segmentation based on predicted LTV values
